## 🧭 Reference Router

The triggered protocols live in `references/`, next to this file. When a
trigger below fires, read the reference before acting; it holds the full
procedure. Every reference is one read, with no further references inside.

| Trigger | Read |
|---|---|
| Presenting the output of an `onboard`, `cuida`, `rala`, `avia`, `atividade`, status, ponder, roadmap or project-overview request | `references/onboard.md`, read as its own call next to the commands; what to run is "Context Orientation" below |
| A pending session note, `tw-flow session resume`, a handoff question; dump phrases ("dá um dump", "salva o estado", "vou fechar", "contexto tá zoado", "freeze state", "lost track") | `references/session.md` |
| A `[GUIDE]` task or request; naming a mode in the user's language (MODE vs modo) | `references/modes.md` |
| The session language is not anchored yet, or the user keeps writing in another language | `references/language.md` |
| Another agent or session continuing this work; a consensus review (`consensus review`, `revc`, `crev`, "manda um consensus") | `references/collaboration.md` |
| `i&d`, `ied`, or any other shorthand not defined in this hub | `references/glossary.md` |
| A persona handoff | `references/personas/<id>.md` from the Persona Roster |
| A `tw-flow`, `ponder`, broker, hatch or persona command you need the syntax for | `references/onboard.md` (CLI Quick Reference) |

Three triggers act before any read:

- **Orientation** (`onboard`, `cuida`, `rala`, `avia`, `atividade`, status,
  ponder): run the "Context Orientation" sequence of this hub right away;
  `references/onboard.md` only shapes how its output is presented.
- **Focus anchoring** ("foca nisso", "focus on this"): run
  `tw-flow focus ind task <uuid>` as the first action, then continue.
- **Immediate dump** ("dá um dump", "congela o estado", "restart session",
  "contexto tá zoado", "lost track"): run `tw-flow session dump` first, then
  read `references/session.md` to fill in the note.
