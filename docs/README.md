## 🌟 The Navigator Ecosystem

We use distinct AI personalities to match your workflow needs. Swapping is conversational—no commands required.

| Navigator | Voice | Specialization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🐊 Jacazul** | PT-BR | Street-smart orientation and quick wins. |
| **{🔷} Codana** | EN | Tactical precision and complex logic. |
| **{💪} Arnalbam** | Bilingual | High-octane motivation and heavy refactoring. |
| **🦉 Atena** | Pedagogical | Step-by-step guidance and workflow training. |

## 🗺️ Documentation Map

Which doc to update when a change is user-facing (the Documentation Mandate
in `AGENTS.md`):

| File | Audience | Intent |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | New users | Entry point. Trigger-based: "I want to X → do Y". Links to docs for depth. |
| `docs/tw-flow.md` | Users | Trigger-based CLI reference. Every command = a trigger + what it does. |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | New users | First-session walkthrough. Minimal prerequisites → first working command. |
| `docs/taskwarrior-expert.md` | Users | 7-phase workflow from the user's perspective. When to use each phase. |
| `docs/interaction-modes.md` | Users | Mode selection guide. "I want to X → use mode Y." |
| `docs/environment-modes.md` | Users | COUNSELOR vs UNHINGED. When and why to switch. |
| `docs/github-broker.md` | Users | Ticket sync triggers and credential-less flow. |
| `docs/tw-flow-cache.md` | Users | Cache behavior, signals, and bypass triggers. |
| `docs/skill-methodology.md` | Contributors / AI Agents | Subject-agnostic rules for creating and maintaining any skill: descriptions, bodies, reference-vs-skill, cross-references, evaluation. |
| `docs/skill-evals.md` | Contributors / AI Agents | Running a skill's eval suite, writing graders that measure what the agent did, reading traces, comparing before and after a change. |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Contributors | Internal design decisions. Not trigger-based — explains *why*, not *how to use*. |
| `AGENTS.md` | AI Agents | Repository mandates no skill carries, and where the rest lives. |

**Writing rule.** `README.md` and every `docs/` file except ARCHITECTURE
follow the **Trigger → Action** pattern: organized around what the user wants
to accomplish, each section answering "when the user does or wants X, they run
or see Y", with internals linked to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` instead of inlined.
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the only file organized from the system's
perspective: design decisions, boundaries and trade-offs, for contributors and
agents investigating root causes.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting & Support

1. Check the **[Technical Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)** for CLI parity and path issues.
2. Use the `onboard` trigger to refresh your agent's context.
3. Consult the **[Verification Methodology](verification-methodology.md)** if tasks are failing Quality Gates.

**Philosophy:** "Plan effectively, execute efficiently, and never lose context."
